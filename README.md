# ssldump-cmake
* original ssldump 0.9.3 sources modified for Debian Stretch - https://packages.debian.org/source/stable/ssldump
* added support for TLSv1.1/2 - nice work from F5 Networks - https://devcentral.f5.com/articles/tls-12-for-ssldump-data-decrypt-revisited
* switch from autotools to cmake on ubuntu18.04 (as it's hard to compile anywhere on centos 5/6/7 or ubuntu18)
